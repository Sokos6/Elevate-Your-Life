Elevate Dashboard with Redux and Auth Integration

Login and register (auth) and to be able to add some dynamic cards from our database (simple add). 
Four actions, one for login, one for register, one for adding the cards to our database (you can think about these as to some todos) and one for getting from the database all these cards (which weâ€™ll render in our app). 
And also, just a store.
